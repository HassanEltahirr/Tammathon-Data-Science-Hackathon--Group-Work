🐱 AI-Powered Cat ID & Passport Verification – Hackathon Project
📝 Project Description

This project was developed during a hackathon hosted by 42 Abu Dhabi in collaboration with TAMM, with a focus on solving real-world challenges using computer vision and artificial intelligence.

The solution was structured around three key tasks:
1. 🐾 Cat Identification

We developed and fine-tuned a deep learning model to accurately classify cat breeds from images.
Key features:

    Experimented with multiple architectures and hyperparameters to maximize performance.

    Integrated a manual verification step to enhance reliability.

    Designed the classification pipeline with a focus on accuracy and robustness.

2. 🛂 Passport Verification

We implemented techniques to verify passport authenticity using a combination of:

    Traditional computer vision methods.

    Deep learning approaches for improved accuracy in detecting tampering or anomalies.

3. 🧠 OpenAI Compass Integration

We leveraged OpenAI Compass and LLMs to:

    Enhance semantic image understanding.

    Automate complex verification tasks through prompt-based reasoning.

👨‍💻 My Role

I worked alongside an amazing team including Ruhan Jaafar and Mazin, contributing primarily to the Cat Identification component:

    🔧 Fine-tuned deep learning models and optimized hyperparameters.

    ✅ Assisted with manual verification processes to ensure classification accuracy.

    🛡️ Focused on building a robust and reliable cat breed verification pipeline.
